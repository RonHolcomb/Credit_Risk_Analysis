# Overview

In this project we took credit card data from LendingClub's first quarter to create an algorithm to determin the risks of loans. We did this by splitting the data and oversampling and undersampling the data. We then compare the two modles to see if they can accurately predict credit risk. With this information we can help our client make better decisions on their lending.
